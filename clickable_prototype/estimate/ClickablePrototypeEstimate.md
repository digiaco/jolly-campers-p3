# Dual-Sided Camper Marketplace & Fleet Management Prototype

---

## Executive Summary

We will design and develop a clickable, investor-ready prototype that visualizes the "Innovation Focus" of your new platform. Unlike a standard MVP, this prototype focuses on high-fidelity simulation of complex features—specifically **Smart Dynamic Pricing**, **AI Support**, and **Cross-Platform Sync**—to demonstrate strategic technological advantages to prospective fleet owners and investors.

### Development Strategy

To balance cost with high-end visual fidelity, we will utilize **Figma** for UI structure and **Framer** for advanced interactivity. This approach allows us to create "realistic transitions" and complex animations without the high cost of React engineering.

## Engagement Protocols & Scope Boundaries

To ensure the project remains efficient and budget-friendly, the following boundaries apply:

1. **Happy Path Only:** The prototype will demonstrate the ideal success scenario (e.g., a successful booking). Error states (e.g., "Card Declined," "No Internet") are excluded unless critical to the flow.

2. **Static Data:** All graphs, calendars, and analytics (e.g., "Regional occupancy trends") will use hard-coded, dummy data. No real-time calculation logic or backend databases will be developed.

3. **Multi-Platform Visual, Single Interactive:** *(Updated)* The Calendar Sync Hub will show ALL major platforms visually (Goboony, Paul Camper, Airbnb, Booking.com, Own website iCal), but only ONE platform will have full interactive flow. Others will be static representations.

4. **AI Simulation:** The AI Support Center will use a pre-scripted linear conversation. It will not be a functional chatbot capable of answering random free-text questions.

5. **Device Focus:** The primary design focus is Desktop.

6. **iFrame Preview Only:** The iFrame booking integration will be a visual mock-up showing the concept. No actual embeddable code will be generated.

7. **Billable Meetings:** All scheduled workshops, reviews, and ad-hoc calls are billable hours.

8. **The "75% Alert":** We will provide a weekly burn report. When 75% of the estimated hours (approx. 184 hours) have been utilized, we will conduct a scope review to prioritize remaining tasks.
