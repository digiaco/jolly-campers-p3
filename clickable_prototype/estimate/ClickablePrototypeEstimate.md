# Dual-Sided Camper Marketplace & Fleet Management Prototype

---

## Executive Summary

We will design and develop a clickable, investor-ready prototype that visualizes the "Innovation Focus" of your new platform. Unlike a standard MVP, this prototype focuses on high-fidelity simulation of complex features—specifically **Smart Dynamic Pricing**, **AI Support**, and **Cross-Platform Sync**—to demonstrate strategic technological advantages to prospective fleet owners and investors.

### Development Strategy

To balance cost with high-end visual fidelity, we will utilize **Figma** for UI structure and **Framer** for advanced interactivity. This approach allows us to create "realistic transitions" and complex animations without the high cost of React engineering.

## Base Estimate Breakdown

This estimate covers the "Happy Path" (ideal user flow) for the Traveler and Fleet Owner experiences. It includes design, logic definition, and interactive development.

| Feature Module | Scope of Work | Est. Hours | Cost (@ $45/hr) |
|----------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| **01. Core Platform Foundation** | The Essentials: Setup of Design System (Typography, Colors), Multi-language variable setup (Dutch/Eng), Traveler Homepage, Search Results, Booking Flow, and Payment Simulation. | 55 h | **$2,475** |
| **02. Smart Pricing Suite** | Investor Logic: Designing the "Earnings impact preview". Includes defining the visual logic for seasonal demand curves and developing the interactive slider animation in Framer. | 25 h | **$1,125** |
| **03. Calendar Sync Hub** | Connectivity Demo: Visualizing the "Sync Onboarding" status. Simulating a "Conflict Warning" flow for one representative platform (e.g., Airbnb). | 18 h | **$810** |
| **04. AI Support Center** | Trust & Automation: Designing the live help widget and scripting a linear troubleshooting conversation (e.g., "How to use the heater") with realistic "typing" animations. | 18 h | **$810** |
| **05. Fleet Ops & Messaging** | Retention Tools: Fleet expansion ROI tables, Service & Maintenance calendar, and Unified Messaging Inbox with automated templates. | 24 h | **$1,080** |
| **06. Project Management & Workshops** | Collaboration: Includes Kickoff, Weekly Progress Reviews, and critical "Logic Workshops" to co-define the business rules for Pricing and AI before design begins. | 15 h | **$675** |
| **TOTAL BASE ESTIMATE** | **(Approx. 6 Weeks)** | **~155 Hours** | **$6,975** |

## Project Roadmap And Timeline

### Phase 1: Logic & Definition (Weeks 1-2)

**Focus:** "The Brainstorming." Turning vague requirements into concrete rules.

**Key Activities:**
- Kickoff Workshop
- Defining the "Math" behind the Smart Pricing graphs (Visual only)
- Scripting the AI Chat conversation
- Wireframing the "Golden Path" user flows

**Client Deliverable:** Approval of Wireframes and Logic Rules.

---

### Phase 2: High-Fidelity Design (Weeks 3-4)

**Focus:** "The Look & Feel."

**Key Activities:**
- Design System finalization
- UI Design of all Core and Dashboard screens in Figma
- Creation of static assets for graphs and calendars

**Client Deliverable:** Review of static high-fidelity screens.

---

### Phase 3: Interactive Development (Weeks 5-6)

**Focus:** "The Magic."

**Key Activities:**
- Importing assets to Framer
- Building the "Earnings Impact" slider animation
- Scripting the AI "Typing" and message sequencing
- Linking pages for the clickable demo

**Client Deliverable:** Final Presentation & File Handover.

## Engagement Protocols & Scope Boundaries

To ensure the project remains efficient and budget-friendly, the following boundaries apply to the Base Estimate:

1. **Happy Path Only:** The prototype will demonstrate the ideal success scenario (e.g., a successful booking). Error states (e.g., "Card Declined," "No Internet") are excluded unless critical to the flow.

2. **Static Data:** All graphs, calendars, and analytics (e.g., "Regional occupancy trends") will use hard-coded, dummy data. No real-time calculation logic or backend databases will be developed.

3. **Single-Instance Sync:** The "Cross-Platform Calendar Sync" will demonstrate the connection flow for one platform (e.g., Airbnb) as a representative example, not all connected platforms listed in the scope.

4. **AI Simulation:** The AI Support Center will use a pre-scripted linear conversation. It will not be a functional chatbot capable of answering random free-text questions.

5. **Device Focus:** The primary design focus is Desktop.

6. **Billable Meetings:** All scheduled workshops, reviews, and ad-hoc calls are billable hours.

7. **The "75% Alert":** We will provide a weekly burn report. When 75% of the estimated hours (approx. 115 hours) have been utilized, we will conduct a scope review to prioritize remaining tasks.

## Innovation Focus (Must Be Demonstrated)

The prototype must visually communicate the strategic technological advantages being developed:

### 1) Smart Dynamic Pricing

Automatically adjusts rental pricing using:
- Seasonal demand
- Competitive pricing across connected platforms
- Vehicle type performance
- Regional occupancy trends

**Prototype Elements:**
- Graphical pricing suggestions
- Earnings impact preview when applying changes

### 2) Cross-Platform Calendar Sync Hub

Two-way sync connections with:
- Goboony
- Yescapa
- PaulCamper
- Camplify
- Airbnb-style platforms

**Prototype Elements:**
- Sync onboarding
- Status of connected platforms
- Conflict warning preview

### 3) Automated Lead Response Tools

Semi-automated communication for fleet owners to reduce workload and boost conversion.

**Prototype Elements:**
- Message window with automated templates
- Instant availability response

### 4) Fleet Profit Optimization Suite

Forecast vehicle performance and fleet expansion ROI.

**Prototype Elements:**
- Occupancy prediction
- Vehicle performance ranking
- Fleet expansion suggestion preview

### 5) Service & Maintenance Automation

Automated reminders based on:
- Odometer readings from check-in/out
- Booking volume
- Custom service intervals

**Prototype Elements:**
- Vehicle service calendar
- Smart reminders

### 6) AI Support Center for Travelers

Instant guidance and issue resolution, reducing owner support tasks. Covers:
- Booking questions
- Policy and insurance clarity
- Vehicle operation support (how to use heater, induction, water pump, etc.)
- Troubleshooting (electrics, gasless models, battery use, etc.)

**Prototype Elements:**
- Traveler help chat preview
- AI knowledge base suggestions during booking
- Support prompt during checkout and trip days

*This reduces support calls for fleet owners, and makes travelers feel safer and more confident, especially first-time renters.*
