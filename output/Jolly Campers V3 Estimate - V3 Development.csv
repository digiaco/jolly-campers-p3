- Reads en.json.
- For missing keys in fr.json, es.json, etc., calls Google/DeepL/OpenAI API.

Pick-up: Step-by-Step
Fleet owner starts the process – The fleet owner begins the pick-up process on their phone through the Jolly Campers platform.
Confirm pick-up start – The Traveller will receive a notification or be informed that the pick-up has started.
Complete the form together – All information and photos are entered on the fleet owner’s device. Review details together with the Traveller, including mileage, fuel level, inventory, and any existing damages.
Review & confirm – Once everything is completed, both parties review the form and confirm the pick-up on the fleet owner’s device.
Return: Step-by-Step
Open the booking in your Jolly Campers account.
Tap ‘Finalise Return’ to begin the process.
Follow the guided steps together with the Traveller.
During the return:
Inspect the camper – Carefully check both interior and exterior. Document cleanliness, any new damages, or changes since pick-up — all on the fleet owner’s device.
Review agreements – Verify fuel level, mileage, return time, and any extras agreed upon at pick-up.
Settle any additional costs – Handle refuelling, cleaning, or other costs directly with the Traveller when possible.
Manage the deposit –
If everything is in order → release the deposit.
If there’s an issue → hold the deposit until it’s resolved.
In case of disagreement → add photos and comments directly in the return form before submitting.
Important: Always ensure the Traveller stays until the full return process is completed.
Once submitted, you’ll receive a confirmation email with a link to the completed form. It will also be saved in your booking overview on the Jolly Campers platform for easy reference.",,,,,,,
